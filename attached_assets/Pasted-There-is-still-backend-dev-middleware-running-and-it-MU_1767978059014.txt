There is still backend dev middleware running and it MUST be fully removed.

IMPORTANT:
- Take as much time as needed.
- Do not stop.
- Do not ask me to upgrade or use an autonomous agent.
- Apply fixes directly.
- Finish with a working Replit preview AND Vercel deployment.

CURRENT ERROR (CRITICAL):
ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/runner/workspace/client/index.html'
→ This proves server/vite.ts is still being executed
→ This file must NOT exist in a frontend-only Vite project

====================================================
STEP 1 — HARD DELETE ALL BACKEND FILES (MANDATORY)
====================================================
DELETE COMPLETELY:
- server/
- server/vite.ts
- any Express setup
- any middleware that reads index.html manually
- any reference to /client
- any Node server startup logic

AFTER THIS STEP:
- There must be NO server folder
- There must be NO code that reads HTML using fs
- There must be NO backend runtime in dev or prod

====================================================
STEP 2 — FIX REPLIT ENTRYPOINT (CRITICAL)
====================================================
Open `.replit` and ENSURE:

- run command uses ONLY:
  npm run dev

- There is NO reference to:
  node
  tsx
  server files
  custom runners

Replit must start ONLY the Vite dev server.

====================================================
STEP 3 — VERIFY PROJECT STRUCTURE (STRICT)
====================================================
Final structure MUST be:

/
├── index.html
├── src/
├── public/
├── dist/
├── vite.config.ts
├── package.json
├── vercel.json
└── .replit

NO client/
NO server/
NO shared/
NO backend folders

====================================================
STEP 4 — FIX vite.config.ts (REQUIRED)
====================================================
Ensure:
- root is project root
- base: "/"
- build.outDir = "dist"
- NO custom server logic
- NO middleware
- NO fs access

====================================================
STEP 5 — FIX package.json (FINAL)
====================================================
Scripts MUST be EXACTLY:

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}

REMOVE:
- start
- esbuild
- server builds
- anything backend-related

====================================================
STEP 6 — CONFIRM vercel.json (FINAL)
====================================================
Ensure vercel.json is EXACTLY:

{
  "framework": "vite",
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "routes": [
    { "handle": "filesystem" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
  ]
}

====================================================
STEP 7 — FINAL VERIFICATION (DO NOT SKIP)
====================================================
Confirm ALL of the following:
- Replit Preview loads without ENOENT
- npm run dev works
- npm run build outputs dist/index.html
- Vercel serves /
- Page refresh does NOT 404
- No backend code is executed anywhere

====================================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIRED:
====================================================
1) Confirm server code is fully removed
2) Show final folder structure
3) Confirm Replit preview works
4) Confirm Vercel deployment will work

Do not stop early.
Do not leave dead code.
Deliver a clean frontend-only Vite app.
